Methods deployed:
* Performing Exploratory Data Analysis to identify null values, data redundancies, outliers
    * Identify use cases of machine learning models
* Preprocessing of features to align with Logistic Regression Guidelines
  * normalization of continuous features, through log transformation
  * feature standardization
  * creating binary features
  * creating one-hot encoded features
* Creating a Logistic Regression to achieve a 89.4% accuracy
  * Visualizing results using a confusion matrix 

Findings: 
  * highest predictors of customers likely to convert were:
      * Having previously been contacted
      * Retained/returning customers
